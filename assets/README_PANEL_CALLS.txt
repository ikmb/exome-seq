What is this?

In the accompanying VCF files, calls are generated only for a specific set of target genes, as defined by a particular panel. 

The variant calls are entirely unfiltered, including removal of filters for multi-mapped reads. This should reveal variants
located in regions otherwise ommitted from calling due to mapping difficulties. 

This is meant for data exploration only and does not represent a "clean" call set.
